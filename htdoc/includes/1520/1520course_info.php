          We will be using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML (with DOM), CSS, XML (with DOM) and possibly other systems as well. Software may be available in University or Departmental labs, or it may required as downloads from the Web.

        <ul>
          <li class="b-five">
            All coding submissions MUST adhere to the coding style guide that can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/matty-digital/90aabd4ddb5fc02da90906b1d44d8f2b" target="_blank">here</a>.

            All submissions MUST be turned in through gitHub. Emailed files will not be considered.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">
            Any code submitted for class MUST run in some capacity. If I run the code and I am hit with a screen full of errors, it will not be accepted. Of course, there will be special cases regarding this, which we will discuss when the time comes.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">
            All necessary files MUST be included with your submission.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">
            To earn full credit, assignments MUST be handed in on time. See the <b>Course Policies</b> section below.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">
            Yes, there will be extra credit!! Lucky you! Any extra credit will be mentioned along with the assignment, or shortly after. Note: you cannot get higher than 100% through extra credit.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">

            Unless otherwise stated, Each student is expected to do his/her own work. If a student caught collaborating / cheating in any way will fail the class immediately and will also immediately be reported to the Department of Academic Integrity and may be subject to stronger actions. Note: Submissions that are alike in a substantive way (not due to coincidence) will be considered to be cheating by ALL involved parties. Please protect yourselves by only storing your files in private directories or repositories, and by retrieving any printouts promptly. For more information on the Academic Integrity Policies of the School of Arts and Sciences, see this <a href="http://www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html">link</a>

            Late Work: Believe it or not, all of you work must be submitted on time. This usually means at or before 11:59pm on the day it's due. The system works like this: 1 class late - 25% off. 2 classes late - 50% off. 3 classes late - you can just keep it, no credit will be given.

          <li class="b-five">
            You are required to attend class. I don't always take attendance, but it is highly likely that I will notice if you aren't there. I know life happens sometimes, so if you have to miss class, please email me to let me know in advance as soon as possible. You will be responsible for getting any in class notes. If a you miss a lecture, you are still responsible for the material covered and it is advised to copy the notes from a classmate. If that isn't possible for some reason, see me and we can arrange something.
          </li>
          <li class="b-five">
            An abundance of information, including announcements, handouts, review sheets and solutions will be posted on the class site (and possibly TA pages as well) throughout the term. You are expected to be aware of all information that is posted on our web pages, and should access them frequently in order to stay current.
